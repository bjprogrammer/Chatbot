Assumptions-
1.) Assumig we are using pull model(as per API design) rather than push model so Push  Notification/Firebase goes out of scope.
2.) Internet connection problem displayed in Toast message and send button disabled in that scenario for version 1
3.) Supports Portrait mode only.
4.) Message time displayed will be time of delivery on device(current mobile time).
5.) Supports API 21-28

Tested for 5-6 inch device (testing device - Oneplus 3T)
