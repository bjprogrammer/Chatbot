Assumptions-  
1.) Assuming we are using pull model(as per API design) rather than push model so Push  Notification/Firebase goes out of scope.  
2.) Internet connection problem displayed in Toast message and send button disabled for version 1 and version 2.  
3.) Supports Portrait mode only.  
4.) Message time displayed will be time of delivery on device(current mobile time).  
5.) Supports API 21-28  
  
Tested for 5-6 inch device (testing device - Oneplus 3T)
